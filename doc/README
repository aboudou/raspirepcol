RasPiRepCol for Raspberry Pi
Version 1.1

********************
Requirements
********************

 - First of all : a Raspberry Pi
 - LED and resistors to build the assembly
   Assembly instructions are available at the following URL
   https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/pages/raspirepcol.en
 - Python (with Debian / Raspbian : packages "python" and "python-dev")
 - RPi.GPIO library (0.3.1a or newer) from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO

To help you with the assembly, you may refer to the following files :
 - raspirepcol.sch : the circuit diagram to open with EAGLE 
   (http://www.cadsoft.de/freeware.htm)
 - raspirepcol.fzz : the assembly mockup to open with Fritzing 
   (http://fritzing.org/)


********************
How to use RasPiRepCol
********************

You'll first have to build the assembly, and plug it to the Raspberry Pi
  (check https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/pages/raspirepcol.en for more 
  information).

When you're done, just launch RasPiRepCol with "python ./raspirepcol.py" as
  root user and start playing :-) When you want / need to stop playing, just
  hit Ctrl + C to quit.


********************
How to play
********************
When the game is started, all LED blink three time. Then you have to choose
game difficulty (aka game speed) : press one of the four switches, and if you
think your choice is the good one, press the same button. Otherwise, press
another switch. When you validate your previous choice, all LED blink twice,
then the game begins.

Then one random LED blink once, and the game waits for the player to push the 
switch in front of it.

If the player push the correct switch, the game blinks again the first LED, then
blinks another random one, and wait for the player to replay the sequence. And
so on... 

If the player press the wrong button, all LED blink three time, and the game
restarts from the beginning.

When you want to skip the game, just hit Ctrl + C to quit.
